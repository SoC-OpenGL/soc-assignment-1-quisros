Usage instructions, directory structure and description 

Problem 1:
- part1ring.cpp: Ring
- part2disc.cpp: Disc
- part3keyboard.cpp: 2D shape of choice, here a section of a keyboard

Problem 2:
- part1gradienttriangle.cpp: Solid triangle with color gradient in body

Not yet successfully implemented the separate shader class, so the shaders are currently defined, compiled and linked entirely within each file, hence the code is much bigger than optimal.
